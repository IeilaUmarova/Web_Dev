        <p><strong>The <em>LION</em> is awesome because it has a muscular, broad-chested body; a short, 
            rounded head; round ears; and a dark, 
            hairy tuft at the tip of its tail.</strong>

        <p> The lion inhabits grasslands, savannahs, and shrublands. 
            It is usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but when persecuted, 
            it adapts to being active at night and at twilight.
            During the Neolithic period, the lion ranged throughout Africa and Eurasia, 
            from Southeast Europe to India, but it has been reduced to fragmented populations 
            in sub-Saharan Africa and one population in western India. It has been listed as 
            Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in African countries 
            have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable 
            outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, 
            habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern.
